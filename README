This repo is based on Drew Neil's Vimcasts episode #27

http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/

Note: the following commands maybe distructive to your existing vim setup make sure you move your
~/.vim and ~/.vimrc out of the way eg:

mv ~/.vim ~/.vim_bak
mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc_bak

Once done then :

mkdir ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim
mkdir undodir
git clone https://github.com/cajone/dotvim.git . ( Note the trailing dot is important but will only work if .vim is empty )

If on a linux system run the next line 

    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~./vimrc

if on a windows system move the .vim/vimrc file to ~/.vimrc

Once this is done we need to download all the bundles defined as git submodules:

git submodule update --init
