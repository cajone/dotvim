This repo is based on Drew Neil's Vimcasts episode #27

Note: the following commands maybe distructive to your existing vim setup make sure and move your
~/.vim and ~/.vimrc out of the way eg:

mv ~/.vim ~/.vim_bak
mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc_bak

Once done then :

mkdir ~/.vim
touch ~/.vim/vimrc
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
