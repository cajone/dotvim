This repo is based on Drew Neil's Vimcasts episode #27

http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/

One of the submodules in this repo is neocomplete, this module requires lua to be compiled into your vim. To find out if this module has been included in your version start vim and type :vim you should see +lua a part of the libraries. If this is not the case refer to the lua documention at https://www.lua.org/start.html

Note: the following commands maybe distructive to your existing vim setup make sure you move your
~/.vim and ~/.vimrc out of the way eg:

mv ~/.vim ~/.vim_bak
mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc_bak

Once done then :

mkdir ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim

git clone git@github.com/cajone/dotvim.git . ( Use this if you have ssh keys in place : Note the trailing dot is important but will only work if .vim is empty )

or

git clone https://github.com/cajone/dotvim.git . ( Note the trailing dot is important but will only work if .vim is empty )

mkdir undodir

If on a linux system run the next line 

    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~./vimrc

if on a windows system move the .vim/vimrc file to ~/.vimrc

Once this is done we need to download all the bundles defined as git submodules:

git submodule update --init

last but not least start vim and run :Helptags to load all the help files for the submodules
